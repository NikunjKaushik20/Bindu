"""InProcessRuntimeProvider — runs the agent in the host process.

This provider is a deliberate no-op: it produces a ``RuntimeHandle`` pointing
at the host-local URL and lets the existing in-process server (started
elsewhere by ``bindufy()``) do the actual work. Its purpose is to make
"default behavior" inspectable through the same abstraction as boxd.
